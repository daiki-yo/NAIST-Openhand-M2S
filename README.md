# NAIST-Openhand-M2S

Contains parts for a modification of the [Yale Openhand M2](https://www.eng.yale.edu/grablab/openhand/model_m2.html) including Optoforce 3D force sensors and bearings, requiring no additional rubber surface manufacturing. The two-degree of freedoms can be used for active perception and manipulation with tactile feedback.
