Refer to the [Finger Fabrication Guide](https://www.eng.yale.edu/grablab/openhand/model%20m2/Fabrication%20-%20Model%20M2%201.0.pdf) of the Yale Openhand M2 for details on the assembly.
This hand　is driven by wire. We used fishing line made of Dyneema.　Refer to the [manual](https://www.eng.yale.edu/grablab/openhand/model%20m2/Fabrication%20-%20Model%20M2%201.0.pdf) for the position of the wire.
The base uses Dynamixel MX-28AT motors. A controller case that can be attached to the base is included in the STL files.
